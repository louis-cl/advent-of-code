input is square of side n
borders are .
straight from S are . (but not for sample)
S is exactly in the middle

reach in s steps => reach in s+2, never in s+1
we care about the parity of any path

zone explored is a diamond (l1 distance)

shortest path from S to tile goes through borders
8 cases depending on the first contact point
since our input is 131x131 first contact is reached in even/odd steps (change at each zone)

the frontier in each quadrant is covered by 2 diagonals of tiles, interior or exterior
in a quadrant all the interior (or exterior) are the same case, because they are at the same distance
so there are 2 cases x 4 quadrants + 4 straight line + full explored odd & even tiles = 14 cases

how many of each ? how far does it go in straight line ?
26501365 = 202300*131+65 so 202300 tiles + 65. 65 is distance between S to inside border of the tile
So in 26591365 steps we reach the exact inside border 202300 tiles further
because we do 202300 tiles, the last tiles in straight lines will be odd (even number of tiles)

how many explored tiles ?
if you look at the exploration after 2 steps (l1 circle of radius 2)
there is a center 1 with odd state, then an englobing layer of even, then a layer of odd.
if you look sideways the odd tiles form a 3x3 grid and the even a 2x2 grid.
Seems like (n+1)^2 odd and n^2 even, which makes sense as #tiles is proportional to area

the outer layer tiles are cut in a very similar ways.
the cut side of the diamond has (n+1) tiles in the inner layer and (n) in the outer
inner layer includes the last straight line tiles so they are odd, and they are 3/4 full approx.
outer layer are even and smaller, 1/8 full approx.

if we always count FULL tiles, the inner layer counts too much but the outer layer is not counted.
if we know how many points are in those cuts, we can remove the inner and add the outer

interestingly each diagonal has these corners, if we count all 4 sides those cuts can be joined (same parity)
so it's like cutting all the corners (4) of a single tile. how many ? as many there are per side (n+1) odd and n even

how many points are in those cuts ?
If we think of a single tile where all the corners are cut, the part in the inside is what's reachable with 65 steps.
So the cuts are the rest, either reacheable in odd or even position

I need to know:
- amount of points in odd&even fully explored tile
- amount of points reachable in 65 steps & 64 steps
given n = 202300, the total exploration is
 (n+1)^2 fully explored odd tiles
+n^2 fully explored even tiles
-(n+1) (fully explored odd - 65-steps explored)
+ n (fully explored even - 64-steps explored)
